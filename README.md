# üå¶Ô∏è Weather Insight Logic

Welcome to **Weather Intelligence System**, a modular Python repository focused on real-world weather logic, data analysis, and user-driven insights. It combines three carefully structured modules: logging weather entries, analyzing temperature variations, and orchestrating system-wide coordination. The design emphasizes educational clarity, object-oriented architecture, and scalable extensions.

---

## üéØ Purpose

This repository showcases Python applied to meteorology and runtime data ecosystems. Each module reflects hands-on design with separation of logic, clear flow control, and reusable structures.

It includes:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with functional separation  
- CLI-based weather logging with local persistence  
- Runtime temperature variation analysis using Pandas  
- Final coordination interface integrating multiple data sources  
- Output export to Excel, Pickle, and CSV formats

## üß© Modules Included

Each folder contains a standalone educational weather module with its own `.py` scripts and dedicated README.

| üìÅ Folder | üîé Description |
|-----------|----------------|
| `weather_data_manager/` | CLI module for logging weather records, storing objects in `.pkl` format using serialization |
| `weather_analyzer/` | Analyzes CSV weather data and outputs top 10 variation days per city into Excel |
| `weather_insight_system/` | Orchestrates logging, analysis, and user interaction into one central runtime flow |
